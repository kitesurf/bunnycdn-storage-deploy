This repo contains 6 actions:

1. Storage Deploy - Which is handy for uploading and removing previous files.
2. Storage Create - Which can create a new Bunny storage.
3. Storage Update - Which can update a Bunny storage.
4. Pull Zone Update - Which can update a Bunny pull zone to fetch data from a different storage zone.
5. Pull Zone Purge - Which can purge a Bunny pull zone.
6. Storage Remove - Which can delete similiar named storage zones only keeping the latest x number of storage zones.

## 1. Storage Deploy

This action performs 3 operations.
* Uploads files and folders to storage.
* Removes all the files from storage.
* Purges pull zone.

Each operation can be activated with their respective upload, remove and purge flags.

| `remove` | It will remove all the files from storage before uploading if "true" provided. storageZoneName and storagePassword inputs should be provided. |
| `purgePullZone` | It will purge the pull zone if "true" provided. pullZoneId and accessKey inputs should be provided. |
| `source` | The source directory that should be uploaded. |
| `destination` | The destination directory that should be uploaded to in the bunny storage zone. (Example: www). The destination should *not* have a trailing / as in www/.
